# Kugle-Embedded
Embedded firmware code for the STM32H7 board on the Kugle robot running the Sliding mode attitude controller and path following MPC, to a certain extent based on code generated by MATLAB coder

# IDE
System Workbench, an IDE based on Eclipse, has been used as the development environment for this embedded firmware. System Workbench is a cross-platform compatible IDE based on Eclipse bundled with both libraries for STM32 devices, GDB debugger and ST-Link debugging capability, enabling easy programming and debugging of embedded applications for STM32 devices.

The IDE can be downloaded from http://www.openstm32.org

## Debugging on Ubuntu
If you get an error similar to _Could not determine GDB version using command_ then you might have installed the 64-bit version of System Workbench. However the bundled GDB debugger is a 32-bit version based on the Linaro releases, why you will have to install the corresponding 32-bit version of _ncurses_.

```bash
sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5
```
